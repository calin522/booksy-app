This is a book library (Similar to Goodreads) [that's being developed live on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5B3VA222tmkDrFiXuJNdG-9Qw8vl9l-I).

## API

The API is located in it's own repistory: [sallar/booksy-api](https://github.com/sallar/booksy-api)

## Development

First make sure to setup your development environment [using this guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) (make sure to click on React Native CLI, and not Expo).

```sh
git clone git@github.com:sallar/booksy-app.git
cd booksy-app
cd ios && pod install && cd -
npx react-native run-ios
```

This will start the app in the iOS simulator.
